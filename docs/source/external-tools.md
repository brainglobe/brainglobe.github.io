# Software built by the community

Tools like the [BrainGlobe Atlas API](/documentation/bg-atlasapi/index) were developed to help establish a community of 
developers creating interoperable tools. The BrainGlobe core developers have created a number of such tools
([cellfinder](/documentation/cellfinder/index), [brainreg](/documentation/brainreg/index), 
[brainrender](/documentation/brainrender/index) etc.). More recently, members of the community have built their own 
software that leverages the BrainGlobe ecosystem in some way:

## Aligning Big Brains & Atlases
Aligning Big Brains & Atlases (ABBA) is a FIJI plugin for the registration of 2D brain sections to an atlas. Using 
the [Python version](https://github.com/BIOP/abba_python) allows users to register their data to any BrainGlobe Atlas.

- [GitHub repository](https://github.com/BIOP/ijp-imagetoatlas)
- [ABBA Python](https://github.com/BIOP/abba_python)

## Brainways
Brainways is a user-friendly tool for mapping single sections to an atlas using deep learning.

- [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bkntr/brainways)
- [Napari plugin](https://github.com/bkntr/napari-brainways)

## MagellanMapper
MagellanMapper is a graphical tool for 3D reconstruction and automated analysis of whole specimens using BrainGlobe 
atlases for registration. 
- [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sanderslab/magellanmapper)
- [Documentation](https://magellanmapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)


## Braintracer
Braintracer is an extension of BrainGlobe providing further analysis tools that build upon brainreg and cellfinder.
- [GitHub repository](https://github.com/samclothier/braintracer)

## pAPRica
pAPRica is a package for analysis of large microscopy datasets that incorporates registration using brainreg.
- [Preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.27.525687v1)
- [GitHub repository](https://github.com/WyssCenter/pAPRica)
- [Documentation](https://wysscenter.github.io/pAPRica/index.html)
