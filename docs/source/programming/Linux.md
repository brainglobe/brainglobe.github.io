### Terminal is not opening after installing a new Python version
If you installed a new Python version without the use of `conda`, there might be a mismatch in the python naming in a bin file.   
If it's possible open terminal through vscode or open a virtual terminal (VT) with CTRL + ALT + F3 and run `gnome-ternimal`.
Does it throw a Python error? If yes run `sudo nano /usr/bin/gnome-terminal` and change `#!/usr/bin/python3` to `#!/usr/bin/python3.10` if the version you're currently using is 3.10.  
Exit the VT via CTRL + ALT + F2.
