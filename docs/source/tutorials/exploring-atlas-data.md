# Exploring atlas data

BrainGlobe atlas data (in version 2) is kindly hosted by AWS, as part of their open data programme. A central part of these efforts is to serve as an archive for public atlas data. In this tutorial, you will learn how to programmatically download and explore the atlas data itself, without using any BrainGlobe tools themselves.

As an example, here, we will show how to use Python to calculate the volume of the retrosplenial area in the Allen mouse atlas.
