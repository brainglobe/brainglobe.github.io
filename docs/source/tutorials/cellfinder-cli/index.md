# `cellfinder` CLI has moved to `brainmapper`

The `cellfinder` command-line tool was renamed with the release of `cellfinder` version `1.0.0`.
You can read about these changes [on our blog](/blog/version1/cellfinder_migration_live).
What you'll most likely want to do is follow the links in the blog post to:

- Upgrade your version of the `cellfinder` package,
- Install `brainglobe-workflows` to get `brainmapper`, the same command-line tool but under it's new name.
  
You can then [head to the `brainmapper` tutorial](../brainmapper/index.md) and follow the steps there.
