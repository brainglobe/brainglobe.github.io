# Analysing brainwide distribution of cells

In this tutorial you will use the [`brainmapper` napari widget](/documentation/brainglobe-utils/transform-widget) 
to analyse the position of some points in an atlas. 

The aim of this tutorial is to illustrate how to use the widget on a small dataset. After completing this tutorial, 
you could try using the widget with the outputs of the 
[whole brain cell detection tutorial](/tutorials/brainmapper/index), or even analysing the data from start to finish 
using [`cellfinder`](/documentation/cellfinder/index), [`brainreg`](/documentation/brainreg/index) and then this 
`brainmapper` widget.

:::{note}
You will need napari installed on your machine, and also to have previously run `brainreg`. Before following the next
steps, please ensure you have followed the
[registering a whole-brain image to an atlas tutorial](/tutorials/tutorial-whole-brain-registration).
