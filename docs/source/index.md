# BrainGlobe
The BrainGlobe Initiative exists to facilitate the development of interoperable Python-based tools for computational neuroanatomy.

We have three aims:

Develop specialist software for specific analysis and visualisation needs, such as cellfinder and brainrender.

Develop core tools to facilitate others to build interoperable tools in Python, e.g. the BrainGlobe Atlas API.

Build a community of neuroscientists and developers to share knowledge, build software and engage with the scientific, and open-source community (e.g. by organising hackathons).
