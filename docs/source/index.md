# Neuroinformatics Unit HowTo

On this website, you can find solutions to common issues that you may encounter when using software tools for neuroscience research (whether made by the Neuroinformatics Unit or not).

The information is primarily aimed at researchers at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre (SWC)](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/) and [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit (GCNU)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/gatsby-computational-neuroscience-unit), though most of it should be useful to neuroscientists in general.
