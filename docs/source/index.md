# BrainGlobe

The BrainGlobe Initiative exists to facilitate the development of interoperable Python-based tools for computational neuroanatomy.

We have three aims:

* Develop specialist software for specific analysis and visualisation needs, such as cellfinder and brainrender.
* Develop core tools to facilitate others to build interoperable tools in Python, e.g. the BrainGlobe Atlas API.
* Build a community of neuroscientists and developers to share knowledge, build software and engage with the scientific, and open-source community (e.g. by organising hackathons).
