# Into uncharted brains: expanding beyond existing atlases

We've just released a [new digital 3D atlas for the Eurasian blackcap](target-blackcap).
This marks a key shift for us: beyond providing a common interface for existing neuroanatomical atlases, we are now also building new ones.

This post explains why we're taking this step, how we're approaching it, and what's next.

## Atlases are essential, and we need more of them

The rise of high-quality digital 3D brain atlases over the past decade has transformed neuroscience.
BrainGlobe has both contributed to and benefited from this shift.
At the core of our ecosystem is the [BrainGlobe Atlas API](target-brainglobe-atlasapi), a unified interface for accessing atlases across species, supporting most of our workflows.
To paraphrase a [famous quote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_in_Biology_Makes_Sense_Except_in_the_Light_of_Evolution):

> Nothing in BrainGlobe makes sense except in the light of atlases.

Atlases help individual researchers plan experiments and interpret their results, but their biggest impact is on the field as a whole.
By providing a common coordinate system and standardised terminology, they make data easier to share, compare, and integrate with other sources.

While excellent atlases exist for common model organisms, such as the [Allen Mouse Brain Atlas](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.007) and the [Adult Zebrafish Brain Atlas](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.69988), they are scarce for less popular species.
Neuroscience is experiencing a welcome [non-model organism renaissance](https://doi.org/10.53053/GMHL7976), but the lack of atlases limits progress.
Without a reliable brain map, it is difficult to apply modern neuroscience to emerging models.

This challenge has driven our recent support for species like the {ref}`axolotl <axolotl-atlas-added>` and the {ref}`prairie vole <prairie-vole-atlas-added>`, with more on the way.
However, for most species, atlases either do not exist or lack the resolution and digital precision required for modern brain mapping.

To support neuroscience in uncharted brains, we need more high-quality atlases.
But creating them is resource-intensive, requiring advanced imaging, computational power, and neuroanatomical expertise.
Given our experience developing BrainGlobe and our access to these resources, we are well-positioned to contribute.
The atlas for the Eurasian blackcap marks our first step in this new direction.

## Why start with the blackcap?

A mix of **_need_** and **_opportunity_** led us to this choice.

**_The need._** Birds possess remarkable traits, one of the most intriguing being their ability to navigate using the Earth's magnetic field.
Migratory birds are key models for studying this phenomenon, yet we lack a high-quality brain atlas for them.
Such an atlas is essential to uncover the neural correlates of magnetoreception and magnetic field-guided navigation.

**_The opportunity_** arose through [Simon Weiler](https://sites.google.com/view/neuroweiler), a postdoc at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre (SWC)](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/), where the core BrainGlobe team is based.
Simon collaborates with [Henrik Mouritsen's lab](https://uol.de/en/ibu/animal-navigation) at the [University of Oldenburg](https://uol.de/en), a group specialising in the magnetic senses of migratory birds.
As part of this collaboration, Simon obtained whole-brain samples from Oldenburg and imaged them at SWC using its state-of-the-art [serial-section two-photon platform](https://swcmicroscopy.com/).

**_The results were outstanding_**â€”exceptionally high-resolution 3D images of whole brains, far surpassing what was available for most bird species. Recognising their value, Simon reached out to us about creating a blackcap brain atlas. This would not only help him analyse his data but also provide a valuable resource for the wider research community.

## How we built the blackcap atlas

TBD.

## More atlases to come!
