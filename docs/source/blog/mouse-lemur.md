# An Atlas for the non-human primate _Microcebus murinus_ (grey mouse lemur) has been added to BrainGlobe

Thanks to its small size and human-like aging phenotype, the grey mouse lemur is a practical choice to study brain evolution and disease. [Nadkarni et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2018.10.067) made the first publicly available mouse lemur atlas in 2018. Thanks to Harry Carey (University of Oslo) it is now accessible to BrainGlobe.

TODO figure.

## Why are we adding new atlases?

A fundamental aim of the BrainGlobe project is to make various brain atlases easily accessible by users across the globe. The axolotl atlas is the first non-human primate brain atlas available through BrainGlobe. If you would like to get involved with a similar project, please [get in touch](/contact).
