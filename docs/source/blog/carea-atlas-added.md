# New mouse brain atlas based on gene expression

The CArea atlas has been added to BrainGlobe. Regions in this atlas are delineated based on clustering 3D volumes of gene expression, finding voxels with similar "gene expression fingerprints". Data from over 1000 mice was used to generate both volumes of gene expression, and an average Nissl template. This template is a slightly improved and updated version the [CCFv3BBP template](https://doi.org/10.1162/imag_a_00565) (also in BrainGlobe as [ccfv3augmented_mouse](https://brainglobe.info/documentation/brainglobe-atlasapi/usage/atlas-details.html#ccfv3-augmented-mouse-atlas)). 

In the future, atlases regions may be defined automatically based on cell type, pathology, or other properties which can be mapped to a template. A paper describing this atlas and the accompanying gene expression dataset is now available on [bioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.64898/2026.01.20.700446). 

- **Atlas name:** `carea_mouse_25um`
- **Resolution:** 25 µm isotropic
- **Template space:** Aligned to the CCFv3BBP

## Why are we adding new atlases?
A fundamental aim of the BrainGlobe project is to make various brain atlases easily accessible by users across the globe. If you would like to get involved with a similar project, please [get in touch](/contact).
