# Developer's guide

## Introduction

**Contributors to BrainGlobe are absolutely encouraged**, whether to fix a bug, develop a new feature, or add a new atlas.

There are many BrainGlobe repositories, so it may not be obvious where a new contribution should go.
If you're unsure about any part of the contributing process, please [get in touch](../../contact.md).

## Before you start

Before starting work on a contribution, please check the repository issue tracker to see if there's already an issue describing what you have in mind.

- If there is, add a comment to let others know you're willing to work on it.
- If there isn't, please create a new issue to describe your idea.

We strongly encourage discussing your plans before you start codingâ€”either in the issue itself or on our [Zulip chat](https://brainglobe.zulipchat.com/).
You are also welcome to join the bi-weekly developer meetings and contribute items to the agenda - check out the [developer-meeting stream on Zulip](https://brainglobe.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/414089-developer-meeting) (requires sign-up) for more information.
This helps avoid duplicated effort and ensures your work aligns with the project's scope and roadmap.

Keep in mind that we often use issues liberally to track development.
Some may be vague or aspirational, serving as reminders for future work rather than tasks ready to be tackled.
There are a few reasons an issue might not be actionable yet:

- It depends on other issues being resolved first.
- It hasn't been clearly scoped. In such cases, helping to clarify the scope or breaking the issue into smaller parts can be a valuable contribution. Maintainers typically lead this process, but you're welcome to participate in the discussion.
- It doesn't currently fit into the roadmap or the maintainers' priorities, meaning we may be unable to commit to timely guidance and prompt code reviews.

If you're unsure whether an issue is ready to work on, just ask!

Some issues may be labelled as `good first issue`.
These are especially suitable if you're new to the project, and we recommend starting there.

Some of our tools have additional information about how data files are organised, where user caches are placed, and similar.
You can view these repositories and the relevant information by heading to the [specific repository developer docs page](./specific_repos.md).

:::{note}
Reviewing code can take a long time, and the BrainGlobe team are usually pretty busy. We'll try to review your
contributions as soon as we can, but it can sometimes take a few weeks. We will always get back to you though!

## To contribute a new atlas

To add a new BrainGlobe atlas, please see the guide [here](/documentation/brainglobe-atlasapi/adding-a-new-atlas).

## To contribute code

Before contributing code, it may be useful to familiarise yourself with the [introduction to the BrainGlobe code for developers](./intro_to_codebase.md) as well as the [testing](./testing.md), [developer tooling](./tooling.md) and [conventions](./conventions.md) sections. 

The core development team will support you in contributing code, irrespective of your experience.
To ensure BrainGlobe remains easy-to-maintain, they will help ensure all code contributions meet 
a high standard.

### Setting up GitHub repository locally.

It is recommended to clone the relevant repositories and setting up keys and verification to contribute to projects. The same steps apply when working with a forked repository.
1. Generate your SSH keys as suggested [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
2. Setup your commit signature verification as shown [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification#ssh-commit-signature-verification)
3. Clone the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:brainglobe/${REPOSITORY_NAME}.git
```

### Creating a development environment

It is recommended to use a recent version of `conda` to install a development environment for
BrainGlobe projects ([`conda` versions >=23.10.0](https://conda.org/blog/2023-11-06-conda-23-10-0-release/) 
will significantly speed up installation time).
Other Python package managers, such as [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), might work,
but we recommend using conda to maintain consistency across packages.
Once you have `conda` installed, the following commands
will create and activate a `conda` environment with the requirements needed
for a development environment:

```sh
conda create -n brainglobe-dev -c conda-forge python=3.12 napari
conda activate brainglobe-dev
```

This installs packages that often can't be installed via `pip`, including
`pyqt`. The specific version of `Python` is chosen to allow `TensorFlow` to be
installed on macOS arm64 machines.

To install a specific BrainGlobe project for development, clone the
GitHub repository, and then run

```sh
pip install -e .[dev]
```

Or if using `zsh`:

```sh
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

from inside the repository. This will install the package, its dependencies,
and its development dependencies.

### Pull requests

In all cases, please submit code to the main repository via a pull request. The developers recommend, and adhere,
to the following conventions:

- Please submit _draft_ pull requests as early as possible (you can still push to the branch once submitted) to
  allow for discussion.
- One approval of a PR (by a repo owner) is enough for it to be merged.
- Unless someone approves the PR with optional comments, the PR is immediately merged by the approving reviewer.
- Please merge via "Squash and Merge" on GitHub to maintain a clean commit history.
- Ask for a review from someone specific if you think they would be a particularly suited reviewer (possibly noting
  why they are suited on the PR description)

## To improve the documentation

Documentation for BrainGlobe is **very important** because it is aimed at researchers who may not have much
computational experience. In particular:

- Installation, although simple via PyPI, assumes a lot (e.g. functional Python installation, CUDA installation etc.).
- There are a lot of parameters that can be changed, and their impact on the final results is not always obvious.
- It is not immediately obvious how to use the results of the pipeline to answer the particular biological question.

For these reasons (and others) every part of all software must be documented as well as possible,
and all new features must be fully documented.

### Editing the documentation

The documentation is hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and the source can be found at
[GitHub](https://github.com/brainglobe/brainglobe.github.io). Most content is found under `docs/source`, where the
structure mostly mirrors the rendered website. To edit a page, please:

- Fork the repository
- Make edits to the relevant pages
- Create a pull request outlining the changes made

If you aren't sure where the changes should be made, please
[get in touch](https://brainglobe.info/contact.html#contributing).
