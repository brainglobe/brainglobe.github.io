# Roadmaps

BrainGlobe roadmaps give you an idea of where the project is heading over the next few months and years.
These roadmaps are usually at a high level for the BrainGlobe project as a whole.
Plans for individual tools are usually discussed on their respective repos, and over at [Zulip](https://brainglobe.zulipchat.com/).

BrainGlobe is a community project, and as such we welcome your feedback. Please [get in touch with us](/contact) if you have
any questions or suggestions. These roadmaps are living documents and will likely be revisited regularly.
