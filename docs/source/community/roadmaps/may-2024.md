# May 2024

The [November 2023 roadmap](november-2023) was our first. This document looks back on the last six months of work 
and outlines plans for the next year.

## Current status

### Progress since the last roadmap
The past few months have focused mostly on improving the maintainability of BrainGlobe as a whole, and making it easier 
to develop new tools in the future. Some developments include (for more details on these, see the [blog](https://brainglobe.info/blog/)):
* The `brainreg` napari plugin is now bundled with `brainreg` to simplify maintenance.
* `brainreg-segment` is now called `brainglobe-segmentation` to reflect its future compatibility with other registration tools.
* The old `cellfinder` command-line tool is now called `brainmapper` and is part of `brainglobe-workflows`. This is part of
work to separate the core BrainGlobe software from convenience tools ("workflows") developed for specific applications.
* The old `cellfinder-core` and `cellfinder-napari` tools have been merged, and are now known just as `cellfinder`. 
This is to simplify maintenance and reduce confusion (we used to have three cellfinders!).
* `bg-space` is now known as `brainglobe-space` to standardise naming.
* `bg-atlasapi` and `bg-atlasgen` have been merged and are now known as `brainglobe-atlasapi` to standardise naming.
* `imio` has been brought into the `brainglobe-utils` package, to reduce the number of packages we maintain. 
* We've increased the robustness of `brainglobe-utils` by adding lots of automated tests.
* `brainrender` has been updated so that it now works with the newest versions of Python.
* A new `LineActor` has been added to `brainrender`.
* `bgheatmap` has been updated so that it now works with the newest versions of Python and now released as `brainglobe-heatmap`.
* `brainglobe` version 1 has been released. This new "metapackage" allows one line installation of all BrainGlobe tools.
* We've fixed a lot of small bugs and hugely reduced the number of open issues. 
* We've standardised the tooling for all repos to simplify development and maintenance.
* We've released `brainrender-napari` to allow for visualisation of atlas-registered data in napari 
(alongside the existing `brainrender`).
* We've fixed a number of scaling and rotation issues with some BrainGlobe atlases.

### Issues
* It is not yet possible to carry out all BrainGlobe functionality via the GUI (although we are 90% of the way there)
* Documentation for some tools is sparse
* Docstrings are often missing, incomplete or not standardised
* We have very few API docs
* Test coverage is variable (some repos are in excellent shape, others not so much!)
* cellfinder uses TensorFlow, and so we're limited to what Python versions we can support for the metapackage
* Only some tools are available on `conda-forge`, and so `conda install brainglobe` is not yet possible.
* There's still a lot of small bugs hanging around
* Use of the napari plugins isn't very integrated (lots of opening and closing, saving & reopening)
* Some of the atlases have inconsistencies that make their use with particular tools difficult


## Future 
### Q3 2024
* PyTorch backend for cellfinder, enabling use with the latest versions of Python & release on conda-forge.
* All tools installable via `conda install brainglobe -c conda-forge`
* Automated benchmarks for cell detection on "real" (full size) data
* Re-release of all (fully standardised) atlases


### Q4 2024
* Generic layer interpreters ([BrainGlobe/10](https://github.com/brainglobe/BrainGlobe/issues/10))
* All analyses possible without leaving napari
* Automated benchmarks for 3D atlas registration on "real" (full size) data
* Registration of 2D (e.g. conventional sections) data to an atlas
* All tools fully documented

### Q1 2025
* All visualisation possible without leaving napari
* Consistent and documented API, e.g. `from brainglobe import cellfinder` or `from brainglobe import cell_detector_3D` (or both)
* Registration of 3D subvolume data to an atlas
* Intuitive navigation of napari plugins
  * Create "metaplugin"
  
### Q2 2025
* Atlas generation within napari
* Facilitate common analyses/visualisation within napari
  * Plot cells per brain region
