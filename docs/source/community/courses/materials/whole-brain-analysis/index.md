# Whole brain microscopy analysis with BrainGlobe and napari

This is designed as an in-person one-day course. However, our aim is that the materials can be referred to after the 
course, and can be used for self-paced learning. 

## Schedule
### Introduction to BrainGlobe (30 mins)

### Installing BrainGlobe (30 mins)

### Registering whole brain microscopy images with brainreg (30 mins)

### Segmenting structures in whole brain microscopy images with brainglobe-segmentation (30 mins)

### Detecting cells in large 3D images with cellfinder (90 mins)

### Analysing cell positions in atlas space (30 mins)

### Visualisation of data in atlas space with brainrender and brainrender-napari (30 mins)

### Tour of other BrainGlobe tools and wrap-up (30 mins)
