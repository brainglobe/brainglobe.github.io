# Troubleshooting

## Improving algorithm performance

`brainmapper` detects cells in a two-stage process, firstly cell candidates are detected.
These are cell-like objects of approximately the correct intensity and size.
These cell candidates are then classified into cells and artefacts by a deep learning step.

### Cell candidate detection

If the initial cell candidate detection is not performing well, then we suggest adjusting the [cell detection parameters](/documentation/cellfinder/user-guide/napari-plugin/all-cell-detection-parameters).
For a better understanding of what these parameters do, it may be useful to consult the [original PLOS Computational Biology paper](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009074).

:::{hint}
In general, false positives (non-cells being detected) is generally ok, as these will be refined in the classification step.
:::

### Cell candidate classification

The classification will use a pre-trained network by default that is included with the software.
This network will usually need to be retrained.
For more details, please see the guide to [retraining the pre-trained network](/documentation/cellfinder/user-guide/training-strategy).

## Fixing technical problems

As `brainmapper` relies on a number of third party libraries, notably

- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/),
- [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone),
- [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn),

there may be issues while running the software.
