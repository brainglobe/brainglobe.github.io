# Command line interface

## Basic usage

To run `brainmapper`, use this general syntax

```bash
    brainmapper -s signal_channel_images  optional_signal_channel_images -b background_channel_images -o /path/to/output_directory -v 5 2 2 --orientation asl
```

:::{hint}
All options can be found by running `brainmapper -h`

## Arguments

### Mandatory

- `-s` or `--signal-planes-paths` Path to the directory of the signal files. Can also be a text file pointing to the files.
- **There can be as many signal channels as you like, and each will be treated independently**.
- `-b` or `--background-planes-path` Path to the directory of the background files. Can also be a text file pointing to the files.
- **This background channel will be used for all signal channels**
- `-o` or `--output-dir` Output directory for all intermediate and final results

:::{caution}
You must also specify the orientation and voxel size of your data, see [Image definition](/documentation/setting-up/image-definition).

### Optional Arguments

#### Only run parts of `brainmapper`

If for some reason you don't want some parts of `brainmapper` to run, you can use the following options.
If a part of the pipeline is required by another part it will be run (i.e. `--no-detection` won't do anything unless `--no-classification` is also used).
`brainmapper` will attempt to work out which parts of the pipeline have already been run (in a given output directory) and not run them again if appropriate.

- `--no-register` Do not run registration
- `--no-detection` Do not run cell candidate detection
- `--no-classification` Do not run cell classification
- `--no-analyse` Do not analyse and export cell positions
- `--no-figures` Do not create figures (e.g. heatmap)

#### Figure options

Figures cannot be customised much, but the current options are here:

- `--heatmap-smoothing` Gaussian smoothing sigma, in microns.
- `--no-mask-figs` Don't mask the figures (removing any areas outside the brain, from e.g. smoothing).

#### Performance, debugging and testing

- `--debug` Increase verbosity of statements printed to console and save all intermediate files.
- `--n-free-cpus` The number of CPU cores on the machine to leave unused by the program to spare resources.
- `--max-ram` Maximum amount of RAM to use (in GB) â€” **not currently fully implemented for all parts of `brainmapper`**

Useful for testing or if you know your cells are only in a specific region;

- `--start-plane` The first plane to process in the Z dimension
- `--end-plane` The last plane to process in the Z dimension

#### Standard space options

- `--transform-all` Transform all cell positions (including artifacts).
