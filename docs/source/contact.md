# Contact

## Questions
If you have any questions, the first point of call is the [image.sc forum](https://forum.image.sc/tag/brainglobe). 
Please ask any questions you may have on here, and we will do our best to answer them. Please tag your question with both
`brainglobe` and the name of the tool you are using (e.g. `cellfinder`). Asking questions on the public forum allows 
others to benefit from the answers, and also allows users and developers of other, related, tools to 
contribute to the discussion.

## Bugs
If you think you have found a bug, please open an issue at the relevant repository on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/brainglobe). If you're not sure how to do this, feel free to report the issue on the forum, and 
we will raise an issue. If you don't know what the correct repository is, please open it on the repository of the 
tool you're using, and we can transfer it if necessary.

## Feature requests
If you have a feature request, please open an issue at the relevant repository. If you have a more general request
(e.g., for a tool that doesn't yet exist), please ask on the forum (it may be that another tool does what you need).

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to the BrainGlobe Initiative, please get in touch with us using the [BrainGlobe developer
discussion page](https://github.com/brainglobe/BrainGlobe/discussions). We always welcome new Pull Requests,
but please take a quick look at the [developer guide](developers/index) first.

## Other ways to get in touch
While we prefer that all discussions about the project are carried out in public, there may be situations in which this 
is not possible. In these situations, please [email](mailto:code@brainglobe.info?subject=brainglobe), the core developers.
