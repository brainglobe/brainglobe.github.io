# BrainGlobe

The BrainGlobe Initiative exists to facilitate the development of interoperable Python-based tools for computational neuroanatomy.

We have three aims:

* Develop specialist software for specific analysis and visualisation needs, such as 
[cellfinder](/documentation/cellfinder/index) and [brainrender](/documentation/brainrender/index).
* Develop core tools to facilitate [others to build interoperable tools in Python](community/external-tools.md), e.g., the 
[BrainGlobe Atlas API](/documentation/brainglobe-atlasapi/index).
* Build a community of neuroscientists and developers to share knowledge, build software and engage with the 
scientific, and open-source community (e.g., by organising hackathons).
