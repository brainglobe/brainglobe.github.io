# bg-AtlasAPI

Many excellent brain atlases exist for different species. Some of them have an API (application programming interface) to allow users to interact with the data programmatically (e.g. the excellent [Allen Mouse Brain Atlas](https://www.brain-map.org)), but many do not, and there is no consistent way to process data from multiple sources.

The brainglobe atlas API (BG-AtlasAPI) deals with this problem by providing a common interface for programmers to download and process data from multiple sources.

Each atlas consists of data files in a common format:

* A "reference" image of a brain (`.tiff`)
* An "annotation" image, with each brain region defined by a unique pixel value (`.tiff`)
* Meshes defining the surface of each brain region (`.obj`)
* A mapping of brain region pixel value to region name, and structure hierarchy (`.json`)
* Metadata defining the shape, orientation etc. of the data, and other info such as animal species and authors (`.json`)
