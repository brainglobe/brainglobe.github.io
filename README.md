# Neuroinformatics Unit HowTo

Source code for the [Neuroinformatics Unit HowTo](howto.neurinformatics.dev) website.

On this website, we keep track of solutions to common issues arising when using software tools for neuroscience research (whether made by the Neuroinformatics Unit or not). The information is primarily aimed at researchers at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre (SWC)](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/) and [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit (GCNU)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/gatsby-computational-neuroscience-unit), though most of it should be useful to neuroscientists in general.

If you wish to edit the website, please read the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.
